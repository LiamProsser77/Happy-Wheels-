# Happy-Wheels-
Happy Wheels is an advanced, physics-based, side-scrolling action game featuring brutal, exaggerated ragdoll physics and over-the-top, comical gore. Players control inadequately prepared characters—including Wheelchair Guy, Irresponsible Dad, and Pogo Stick Guy—as they navigate treacherous, community-created obstacle courses to reach the finish.
